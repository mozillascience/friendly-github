Welome to the Small Group Work Session!
Let's collaboratively design a Data Management Course with modules.   

1. **Break into groups of 3-4 people**.
2. **Designate a group coordinator**. This person will fork my template repo and coordinate your groups contributions. 
3. **Claim a module topic** from [here](https://github.com/daniellecrobinson/Data-Management-Modules-RDAP) - your group will map out content for that module. 
4. **Group coordinator forks the repo** 
- at this point, the coordinator can make group members into collaborators
- but we encourgae group members to fork the repo of the group coordinator, add content, and make a pull request.
5. **Make a new .md document** in the repo and write a description for your module
**Check point** Does each group coordinator have a forked copy of the template file with a new, uniquely named .md file for their module?
6. Group members fork the repo of the group coordinator, which will contain the new Your-Module.md document
7. Each member add a section to the Your-Module.md
8. Merge the forks
9. Resolve the conflics!
**Check point** Does every group have one, uniquely named Your-Module.md file that contains content from each group member?
11. Group Coordinators **make a pull request** back to Danielle's repo. 
12. Watch the magic happen, as all modules are added to the main repo!


30-35 people, small groups of 3-4
